# Adult Income Prediction

**Predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year using census data.**

## Project Overview
This project uses the **Adult Income Dataset** from Kaggle to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features such as `age_group`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and detecting outliers.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying PCA for feature visualization.
- **Classification Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC, and AUC analysis.
- **Income Prediction:** Predict income for new profiles based on the trained model.
